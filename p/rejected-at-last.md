title: Rejected At Last!

Yesterday I was on my way to San Francisco to meet with my co-workers and spend a bunch of time with my friends when I was unexpectedly refused entry to the United States. I'm writing this down so I can point my friends, colleagues and family at it rather than recount the story separately to each of them.

I've been working for American companies for almost 20 years now. I lived in America for 4 years until 2004, but otherwise have lived elsewhere. In most of those instances, I was legally employed by a corporate entity registered wherever I was living. More recently, when I signed on with CircleCI, they were sufficiently small that being paid locally was not a supported configuration. No problem though, I can be paid as a contractor, get myself an Employer Identification Number, file a W9, and I'm all good. This works well for me, I can get paid some yankee dollar, write off a bunch of expenses, take some side work as a hacker school mentor, etc.

This is not an unusual situation, but whenever I travel to the US, the level of paranoia it generates is overwhelming. In the old days I would sometimes find myself getting tongue tied about what I was supposed to be doing while I was there, but it was always basically good because I was not technically employed by an American company. But they would always dig dig dig and try to see how it was that I was managing to legally get away with working on American soil, for an American company, whilst foreign and not in possession of a work visa. It must have seemed like such a scam.

And that's basically what it is. I've worked in remote teams of one kind or another now for 13 years. Some work better than others - the ones where *everyone* is remote, but within about 3 hours of timezones of each other are the best in my experience, and nothing is quite as productive as colocation, but the point is, it's an increasingly common model, to be working together, as a single corporate business, across multiple legal entities, themselves all commonly owned by some parent, or network leading to a parent. Or, at the other extreme, some of those legal entities may be sole trading consultants such as myself.

So when I enter the United States to spend a week meeting with and doing project work with my various co-workers from the many countries we now inhabit, I must say that yes, I am compensated for my time while I'm there, and yes, I'm compensated by an American company, and I'll be on American soil, and yes, I'll be working on the things they're paying me to work on, but... but what? That's it.

Why doesn't this happen more? I honestly don't know. I suspect it's because most people lie, and are lucky enough to not be pushed. I've been advised by a lawyer friend to tell them I am meeting with clients. I do this, and others report success. I have had some success in the past (the last 3 times or so), but when asked if I would be working while I'm there, what is the correct answer? The truthful one is "yes".

Other than that, it was a fairly typical dehumanizing border experience. I have a couple of observations about that.

1. I was the only white person I saw in secondary screening.
2. The people working in immigration wear black shirted uniforms.
3. Every male uniformed officer I saw was a skinhead.
4. In secondary screening, everything moves very slowly. My impression is that this is a form of mental torture.
5. In secondary screening, you are not allowed to use electronics of any form. My impression is that this too is a form of mental torture.
6. When I was insufficiently contrite, a young angry-faced skinhead in black shirt told me to sit down and come back when I had "lost the attitude".
7. When I asked what would happen if I didn't sign the withdrawal of my application (to enter?), a young angry-faced skinhead in a black shirt told me "then I will detain you and you will go up in front of an immigration judge, do you want that?"
8. When I asked why the black shirted American skinhead needed my Canadian drivers' license, when he was already in possession of my Canadian passport, he said irritably "do you want to travel to the US?" (What I didn't grasp until later was that he meant "ever again", not "today". I have no idea what the basis of that threat was.)

Some may say that if a black shirted angry-faced skinhead says I have a bad attitude, well then, I have a bad attitude and I should take it home with me and shut up. That's fair. IMO those people would either be idiots or just so unbelievably white that who even cares what they think.

At this point I'm not sure if this has any longer term implications for me. It probably does, even if it doesn't, if you know what I mean.

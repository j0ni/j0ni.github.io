      <h1>Profile</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        I'm a Software Engineer with an eclectic background. I've worked for the
        Prison Service (UK), done application and security architecture,
        security technology research, been trained in moral, political and
        natural philosophy and even acquired a USPA skydiving license along the
        way. I've moved continents twice and countries three times. All of this
        contributes to my unique perspective on software engineering. I have over
        20 years' experience in a range of technology roles, and am always
        keen to work with new tools. I am a programming language nerd as
        time allows, but I'm also happy in the infrastructure, automating
        deployments or doing performance analysis. I enjoy working in small
        tight-knit teams and alone. I favour development projects which use
        lightweight processes, continuous integration and delivery for fun,
        profit and risk mitigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am authorized to work in Canada, Germany and the UK. I am not currently
        authorized to work in the US, but have been in the past. I have been
        working remotely for over 15 years, as an employee and a freelancer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My current hourly contract rate is $100 USD. I am however quite
        flexible; I'm willing to charge less for great, socially and politically
        agreeable projects, and to charge more for larger, less appealing gigs
          for employers with fatter wallets.

      <h1>Skills &amp; Technologies</h1>

      <p>
        I have extensive experience specializing in <b>UNIX</b> and UNIX-like
        operating systems, many <b>Linux</b> distributions including
        cloud favourites such as <b>Ubuntu</b>, <b>Amazon Linux</b> and <b>CentOS</b>.
        I use <b>Arch Linux</b> as my desktop. I also have extensive experience
        with <b>Solaris</b> unsurprisingly, and am familiar with <b>MacOS</b> and
        <b>OpenBSD</b>.

        I have <b>DevOps</b> experience, managing production systems using <b>Puppet</b>,
        and more recently managing AWS deployments using <b>Terraform</b>, <b>Pulumi</b>
        and <b>Convox</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am an accomplished programmer, writing code these days primarily in
        <b>Clojure</b>, <b>ClojureScript</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>Go</b>. I have
        written code for a living in <b>Java</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Javascript</b>
        (mostly <b>Node.js</b>), <b>Perl</b> and a little <b>C</b>. I try to
        learn new languages continuously - I'm particularly interested in
        opportunities to work with strongly typed languages such as <b>Rust</b>,
        <b>OCaml</b>, <b>Haskell</b> or <b>Idris</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        I've designed and built application architectures involving many
        different kinds of connective tissue, like <b>Kafka</b>, <b>Redis</b>,
        <b>Amazon Kinesis</b>, and <b>SQS</b>. I've worked with various
        databases, including <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>DynamoDB</b>,
        and <b>Cassandra</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I much prefer <b>lightweight development processes</b>, <b>very small
        teams</b>, and programming practices with <b>short feedback cycles</b>,
        including <b>REPL based development</b>, <b>continuous testing</b> or
        <b>test driven design</b>, depending on the language and context. I also
        prefer <b>continuous integration and delivery</b>. I am not religious
        about any particular methodology; I have found that different approaches
        serve different goals, technologies, tools and cultures.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a committed <b>Emacs</b> user. Enough said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, my communication skills are excellent; I have made numerous
        presentations as a part of my work, and have presented and facilitated
        at software conferences (though I have no interest in doing more of
        this!). In previous roles I have provided ad hoc, formal and informal
        training sessions. I've also trained non-technical end-users, and
        mentored novice web developers.

          <h4>Senior Engineer, Xapix Software GmbH - June 2020-now</h4>

          <p>
              I recently moved to Berlin, where I've joined
              <a href="https://xapix.io">Xapix Software</a> to work as the third
              member of the backend team. Xapix is an integration and orchestration
              platform, enabling users to pull data from heterogeneous sources, including
              HTTP endpoints and event sources such as <b>Azure Event Hub</b> and <b>Kafka</b>.
              The runtime (aka Clojud) is written in <b>Clojure</b> and makes heavy use
              of Kafka. Whilst Clojud is currently used mostly for integration use cases,
              it is fundamentally a code orchestration platform, capable scheduling and
              coordinating user supplied code written in Clojure, Javascript and Ruby
              with more languages planned. The Xapix product uses a JSON based pipeline
              language which is assembled from a graph-based visual language, providing
              users with a powerful low-code development environment.

            <a href="https://www.thedataguild.com">The Data Guild</a>
            is a hothouse for socially responsible data science projects; its members
            are some of smartest, kindest people I've encountered in STEM.

          <h5>Senior Engineer, Motiva, 2017-2020</h5>

          <p>
              Motiva is a communication and relationship management platform, with
              ML-driven message and send time tuning. I worked on the Clojure backend
              components improving reliability and scalability on the first generation
              product, and designed and built the backend components of the new CX
              product.

          <h5>Senior Engineer, AGL Project, Summer 2017</h5>

          <p>
              I joined this project, a peer-to-peer marketplace for solar energy
              trading, when it was already underway, tasked with improving the
              development to deployment workflow, and stabilizing the production
              environment. I implemented Terraform, so that deployment environments
              could be spun up on demand (including VPC, ECS, ELK, scheduling,
              metrics collection and event alerting components), introduced continuous
              deployment to ECS, and wrote a bunch of tests to make that less terrifying.

        <h4>Staff Engineer, Appcanary - Winter and Spring 2017</h4>

        <p>
            Appcanary was a security product created by friends in Toronto. It
            aggregated many sources of security advisories and notified users when
            monitored systems were impacted. It was written in Ruby on Rails and Go.
            In 2018 it was acquired by Github.

        <h4>Senior Engineer, CircleCI - 2014-2016</h4>

        <p>
            Joined CircleCI in September 2014 as its first resident Canadian
            employee. I worked on code throughout the product, which is written
            mostly in Clojure and (back then) ClojureScript and deployed to AWS.
            CircleCI evolved quickly over the time I was there, both technically
            and organizationally. I helped grow CircleCI in Canada, hiring
            local engineers and bootstrapping a Toronto office.

          and Rails) and JavaScript (NodeJS, JQuery, AngularJS, React). Very
          rewarding spare time work.

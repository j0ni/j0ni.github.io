        <h1>Profile</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          I'm a Software Engineer currently working on a
          Continuous Integration platform,
          <a href="http://circleci.com">CircleCI</a>. I have an
          eclectic background, with work in the UK Prison Service
          which alongside software development, application and
          security architecture, security technology research,
          training in moral, political and natural philosophy, and a
          USPA skydiving license, contributes to my unique perspective
          on software engineering and network security. I have 20
          years of experience in a range of technology roles, and am
          always keen to work with new technology. I am a programming
          language nerd as time allows, but am also happy in the
          infrastructure, automating deployments or doing performance
          analysis. I enjoy working both in tight-knit teams and
          alone. I favour development projects which use lightweight
          processes, continuous integration and delivery for fun,
          profit and risk mitigation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am authorized to work in Canada and the EU. I am not
          currently authorized to work in the US, but have been in the
          past. I have been working remotely for over 10 years.

        <h1>Skills &amp; Technologies</h1>

        <p>
          I have extensive experience specializing in <b>UNIX</b>
          and UNIX-like operating systems, including many
          <b>Linux</b> distributions (starting with
          <b>Slackware</b> 2.0, moving to <b>Red Hat</b>,
          <b>SuSE</b>, <b>Fedora</b>, <b>Gentoo</b>, <b>Debian</b>
          and <b>Ubuntu</b>), <b>Solaris</b> (starting with
          2.5.1), <b>OpenBSD</b>, and my current desktop, <b>Mac
          OS X</b>. I have a good understanding of and practical
          experience with <b>Solaris 10</b>, <b>Solaris 11</b>
          security. I have managed production systems using
          <b>Puppet</b> including a deployment of around 140
          OpenSolaris hosts running an array of diverse products
          and applications including <b>Sun Directory Server
          Enterprise Edition</b>, <b>Glassfish</b>, <b>Apache</b>
          and <b>Sun Java System Instant Messaging Server</b>. In
          recent roles I have used the <b>PaaS</b> provider
          <b>Heroku</b> supported by their many wonderful
          "addons", along with <b>Amazon Web Services'</b>
          <b>S3</b> service and <b>EC2</b> for some aspects of
          development and performance testing. My most recent role
          uses <b>EC2</b> and <b>S3</b> extensively, and
          integrates with other Amazon services such as the
          recently released <b>CodeDeploy</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am well versed with the use of many open source security
          tools of the types listed
          at <a href="http://insecure.org/tools.html">insecure.org</a>
          and am experienced in the reading of packet dumps and other
          <b>Network Security Monitoring</b> activities.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am an accomplished programmer, having written code for a
          living in <b>Java</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Javascript</b>
          (or <b>CoffeeScript</b>), <b>Perl</b>, <b>Python</b>,
          a little <b>C</b> and most recently a lot of <b>Clojure</b>
          and <b>ClojureScript</b>. My web application development work
          has involved <b>HTML 4</b> and <b>5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>,
          <b>SCSS/SASS/LESS</b>, <b>jQuery</b> and <b>AngularJS</b> as well
          as modern web design frameworks such as <b>Twitter Bootstrap</b>.
          I have been pursuing personal projects in <b>Lisp</b> and
          <b>Scheme</b>, and occasionally fiddle with <b>Haskell</b>. I
          am an aspiring polyglot; new language skills are quickly
          acquired.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previous <b>Java</b> programming roles have led me to
          acquire expertise in a number of enterprise class
          frameworks such as <b>Hibernate</b> (natively, and also
          as a <b>J2EE</b> entity manager implementation, using
          vanilla <b>JPA</b>), <b>Spring</b>, <b>Jersey</b>
          (<b>JAX-RS</b> implementation), <b>Lucene</b>,
          <b>Velocity</b> and <b>Quartz</b>. I have worked on
          <b>Ruby on a Rails</b> and <b>Node.js</b> applications
          backed by both relational (<b>MySQL</b> and
          <b>PostgreSQL</b>) and <b>NoSQL</b> (<b>MongoDB</b>)
          databases. I have made use of <b>RSpec</b> and
          <b>Cucumber</b> for <b>behaviour driven design</b> in
          Ruby, <b>Mocha</b> and <b>Jasmine</b> for
          Javascript/Node; for performance testing and investigation I
          have used <b>Apache JMeter</b> and <b>VisualVM</b>. In a
          recent devops role, I implemented and managed a 12 node
          <b>Cassandra</b> cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          I much prefer <b>lightweight development processes</b>,
          very <b>small teams</b>, and programming practices with
          <b>short feedback cycles</b>, including <b>REPL based
          development</b>, <b>continuous testing</b> or <b>test
          driven design</b>, depending on the context. I also
          prefer <b>continuous integration and delivery</b>. I am
          not religious about any particular methodology; I have
          found that different approaches serve different goals,
          technologies, tools and cultures.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tend to favour <b>Emacs</b> as my primary IDE, though
          I have in the past used <b>NetBeans</b> and to a lesser
          degree, <b>Eclipse</b> professionally. I've used and
          quite liked <b>Cursive Clojure</b> (based on Jetbrains'
          <b>IntelliJ</b>). I have experience with a variety of
          development tools such as <b>GNU make</b>,
          <b>Leiningen</b>, <b>Maven</b>, <b>Ant</b>, <b>Rake</b>
          and <b>Capistrano</b> for build lifecycle control;
          <b>CircleCI</b>, <b>Hudson/Jenkins</b> and
          <b>Tddium</b> for continuous integration and deployment;
          <b>Git</b> and previously <b>Subversion</b> for source
          code management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last but not least, my presentation and communication skills
          are excellent; I have made numerous presentations as a part
          of my work, and have presented and facilitated at software
          conferences; in previous roles I have provided ad hoc and
          formal training in the use of <b>DTrace</b>. I've also
          trained non-technical end-users, and currently mentor novice
          web developers for several hours per week.

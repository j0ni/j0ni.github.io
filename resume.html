      <h1>Profile</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        I'm a Software Engineer with an eclectic background. I've worked for the
        Prison Service (UK), done application and security architecture,
        security technology research, been trained in moral, political and
        natural philosophy and even acquired a USPA skydiving license along the
        way. I've lived on two continents and in three countries. All of this
        contributes to my unique perspective on software engineering. I have
        over 20 years' experience in a range of technology roles, and am always
        keen to work with new tools. I am a programming language nerd as time
        allows, but I'm also happy in the infrastructure, automating deployments
        or doing performance analysis. I enjoy working in small tight-knit teams
        and alone. I favour development projects which use lightweight
        processes, continuous integration and delivery for fun, profit and risk
        mitigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am authorized to work in Canada, Germany and the UK. I am not
        currently authorized to work in the US, but have been in the past. I
        have been working remotely for over 15 years, as an employee and a
        freelancer for USian, Canadian and German clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to health issues I have been out of action since mid-2020. I plan to
        spend the next 12 months (at least) split between Toronto and Berlin,
        and am ideally looking for project based contracts in service of
        socially and politically agreeable goals, such as putting carbon into
        the ground or billionnaires on Mars, or any other planet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, once my kids have finished university, I would like to
        retire into the life of a subsistence hacker, working for physicists,
        microbiologists and/or climatologists.

      <h1>Skills &amp; Technologies</h1>

      <p>
        I have extensive experience specializing in <b>UNIX</b> and UNIX-like
        operating systems, many <b>Linux</b> distributions including cloud
        favourites such as <b>Ubuntu</b>, <b>Amazon Linux</b> and <b>CentOS</b>.
        I currently use <b>Fedora Silverblue</b> as my desktop, though <b>Arch</b> is
        my more natural home. I also have extensive experience with <b>Solaris</b>
        unsurprisingly, and am familiar with <b>MacOS</b> and <b>OpenBSD</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a lot of <b>DevOps</b> experience, managing production Solaris
        systems using <b>Puppet</b>, and more recently managing AWS deployments
        using <b>Terraform</b> and <b>Pulumi</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am an accomplished programmer, writing code these days primarily in
        <b>Clojure</b>. I've worked in <b>ClojureScript</b>, <b>Python</b> and
        <b>Go</b> quite recently, and am currently enamoured with Rust. I have
        written code for a living in <b>Java</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Javascript</b>
        (mostly <b>Node.js</b>), <b>Perl</b> and a little <b>C</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've designed and built application architectures involving many
        different kinds of connective tissue, including <b>Kafka</b>, <b>Redis</b>,
        <b>Amazon Kinesis</b>, and <b>SQS</b>. I've worked with various
        databases, including <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>DynamoDB</b>,
        and <b>Cassandra</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I much prefer <b>lightweight development processes</b>, <b>very small
        teams</b>, and programming practices with <b>short feedback cycles</b>,
        including <b>REPL based development</b>, <b>continuous testing</b> or
        <b>test driven design</b>, depending on the language and context. I also
        prefer <b>continuous integration and delivery</b>. I am not religious
        about any particular methodology; I have found that different approaches
        serve different goals, technologies, tools and cultures. Except <b>Emacs</b>,
        which is a universal invariant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, my communication skills are excellent; I have made numerous
        presentations as a part of my work, and have presented and facilitated
        at software conferences (though I have no interest in doing more of
        this!). In previous roles I have provided ad hoc, formal and informal
        training to colleagues and customers. I've also trained non-technical
        end-users, and mentored novice web developers.

        <h4>Senior Engineer, Xapix Software GmbH - 2020-2021</h4>

        <p>
          I recently moved to Berlin, where I joined
          <a href="https://xapix.io">Xapix</a> as the third member of the
          backend team. Xapix is an integration and orchestration platform,
          bringing together data from heterogeneous sources, (HTTP APIs and
          event sources). The runtime is written in Clojure and makes heavy use
          of Kafka. Integration use cases dominate the product offering, but the
          platform is fundamentally a low code orchestration platform, capable
          of coordinating user supplied code written in Clojure, Javascript and
          Ruby with support for more languages falling out of its use of
          GraalVM.

          <h5>Senior Engineer, Motiva, 2017-2020</h5>

          <p>
            Motiva is a communication and relationship management platform, with
            ML-driven message and send time tuning. I worked on the Clojure backend
            components improving reliability and scalability on the first generation
            product, and designed and built the backend components of the new CX
            product.

          <h5>Senior Engineer, AGL Project, Summer 2017</h5>

          <p>
            I joined this project, a peer-to-peer marketplace for solar energy
            trading, when it was already underway, tasked with improving the
            development to deployment workflow, and stabilizing the production
            environment. I implemented Terraform, so that deployment environments
            could be spun up on demand (including VPC, ECS, ELK, scheduling,
            metrics collection and event alerting components), introduced continuous
            deployment to ECS, and wrote a bunch of tests to make that less terrifying.

        <h4>Staff Engineer, Appcanary - Winter and Spring 2017</h4>

        <p>
          Appcanary was a security product created by friends in Toronto. It
          aggregated many sources of security advisories and notified users when
          monitored systems were impacted. It was written in Ruby on Rails and Go.
          In 2018 it was acquired by Github.

        <h4>Senior Engineer, CircleCI - 2014-2016</h4>

        <p>
          Joined CircleCI in September 2014 as its first resident Canadian
          employee. I worked on code throughout the product, which is written
          mostly in Clojure and (back then) ClojureScript and deployed to AWS.
          CircleCI evolved quickly over the time I was there, both technically
          and organizationally. I helped grow CircleCI in Canada, hiring
          local engineers and bootstrapping a Toronto office.

          I worked on the web development course, which covered Ruby (Sinatra
          and Rails) and JavaScript (NodeJS, JQuery, AngularJS, React). Very
          rewarding spare time work.

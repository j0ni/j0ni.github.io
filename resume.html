      <h1>Profile</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        I'm a Software Engineer with an eclectic background. I've worked for the
        Prison Service (UK), done application and security architecture,
        security technology research, been trained in moral, political and
        natural philosophy and even acquired a USPA skydiving license along the
        way. I've moved continents twice and countries three times. All of this
        contributes to my unique perspective on software engineering. I have over
        20 years' experience in a range of technology roles, and am always
        keen to work with new tools. I am a programming language nerd as
        time allows, but I'm also happy in the infrastructure, automating
        deployments or doing performance analysis. I enjoy working in small
        tight-knit teams and alone. I favour development projects which use
        lightweight processes, continuous integration and delivery for fun,
        profit and risk mitigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am authorized to work in Canada and the EU. I am not currently
        authorized to work in the US, but have been in the past. I have been
        working remotely for over 15 years, the last 3+ years as a freelancer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My current hourly rate is $100 USD. I am however quite flexible; I'm
        willing to charge less for great, socially and politically agreeable
        projects, and to charge more for larger, less appealing gigs for
        employers with fatter wallets.

      <h1>Skills &amp; Technologies</h1>

      <p>
        I have extensive experience specializing in <b>UNIX</b> and UNIX-like
        operating systems, many <b>Linux</b> distributions including
        cloud favourites such as <b>Ubuntu</b>, <b>Amazon Linux</b> and <b>CentOS</b>.
        I use <b>Arch Linux</b> as my desktop. I also have extensive experience
        with <b>Solaris</b> unsurprisingly, and am familiar with <b>MacOS</b> and
        <b>OpenBSD</b>.

        I have <b>DevOps</b> experience, managing production systems using <b>Puppet</b>,
        and more recently managing AWS deployments using <b>Terraform</b> and <b>Convox</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am an accomplished programmer, writing code these days primarily in
        <b>Clojure</b>, <b>ClojureScript</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>Go</b>. I have
        written code for a living in <b>Java</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Javascript</b>
        (mostly <b>Node.js</b>), <b>Perl</b> and a little <b>C</b>. I try to
        learn new languages continuously - my current fixation is <b>Rust</b>. I
        would love an opportunity to use it in a non-trivial project.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've designed and built application architectures involving many
        different kinds of connective tissue, like <b>Kafka</b>, <b>Redis</b>,
        <b>Amazon Kinesis</b>, and <b>SQS</b>. I've worked with various
        databases, including <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>DynamoDB</b>,
        and <b>Cassandra</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I much prefer <b>lightweight development processes</b>, <b>very small
        teams</b>, and programming practices with <b>short feedback cycles</b>,
        including <b>REPL based development</b>, <b>continuous testing</b> or
        <b>test driven design</b>, depending on the language and context. I also
        prefer <b>continuous integration and delivery</b>. I am not religious
        about any particular methodology; I have found that different approaches
        serve different goals, technologies, tools and cultures.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am an <b>Emacs</b> user. Enough said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, my communication skills are excellent; I have made numerous
        presentations as a part of my work, and have presented and facilitated
        at software conferences (though I have no interest in doing more of
        this!); in previous roles I have provided ad hoc, formal and informal
        training sessions. I've also trained non-technical end-users, and
        mentored novice web developers.

        <h4>Affiliate, The Data Guild - 2016-now</h4>

        <p>
          I've been doing contract work on projects at <a href="https://www.thedataguild.com">
          The Data Guild</a> for a while now. The Guild is a hothouse for
          socially responsible data science and related projects; it's members
          are some of smartest, kindest people I've encountered in STEM.
        </p>

        <section class="">
          <h5>Senior Engineer, Motiva, 2016-now</h5>

          <p>
            Initially I worked on improving reliability and scalability on the
            first generation Motion product; more recently I designed and built
            a major component of the new CX product, working in a team of two
            backend engineers, alongside a two person frontend team and a data
            scientist.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>Senior Engineer, AGL Project, Summer 2016</h5>

          <p>
            I joined this project when it was already underway, tasked with
            improving the development to deployment workflow, and stabilizing
            the production environment. I transitioned a brittle homegrown AWS
            deployment system to Terraform, so that deployment environments could
            be spun up on demand (including VPC, ECS, ELK, scheduling, metrics
            collection and event alerting components), introduced continuous
            deployment to ECS, and wrote a bunch of tests to make that less
            terrifying.

        <h4>Contract Engineer, Skalera - Part time, Feb-current</h4>

        <p>
          Built an anomaly detection pipeline using DynaTrace, AWS Kinsis
          Analytics and InfluxDB. We hope to make use of AWS SageMaker and build
          early warning system.

        <h4>Staff Engineer, Appcanary - Winter and Spring 2016</h4>

        <p>
          Appcanary is a security product. It aggregates several sources of
          security advisories, and with the help of an agent, alerts users when
          their systems are impacted. Mostly Ruby on Rails and Go at a small
          startup here in Toronto.

        <h4>Senior Engineer, CircleCI - 2014-2016</h4>

        <p>
          Joined CircleCI in September 2014 as its first resident Canadian
          employee. In my role in Platorm Engineering and Site Reliability, I
          worked on code throughout the product, which is written mostly in
          Clojure and ClojureScript, and deployed to AWS. CircleCI evolved
          quickly over the time I was there, both in terms of technical
          architecture and organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          Helped grow CircleCI in Canada, hiring local engineers and
          bootstrapping a Toronto office.

        <h4>Teaching Assistant and Mentor, Lighthouse Labs - 2016</h4>

        <p>
          I worked on the web development course, which covered Ruby (Sinatra
          and Rails) and JavaScript (NodeJS, JQuery, AngularJS, React). Very
          rewarding spare time work.

      <section>
        <h4>Senior Tools & Automation Engineer, DevOps, Turn Inc - 2013-2014</h4>

        <p>
          Focused on development projects in support of technical operations. Built
          out a time series database service using KairosDB, a Cassandra-based
          project. This involved a lot of component assembly and automation. My
          favourite part to do was a pre-processing layer written as a NodeJS
          application.

          platform. We used Heroku, Rails, NodeJS, MongoDB. I have since learned

        <h4>Software Engineer, Sun Microsystems/Oracle Canada - 1997-2012</h4>

        <p>
